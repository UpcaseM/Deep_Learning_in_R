# Deep Learning with R

Here are some learning projects with R using Tensorflow and Keras. 

## Projects List

### Binary Classification

### Multiclass Classification

### Image Classification


## Prerequisites


- [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)(R versions 3.2 and higher)
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (I use Windowns 10.)
- [Install Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- Install keras and Tensorflow in R. See detail instructions [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/reference/install_keras.html).

All packages required are provided in each notebook or R script.

## Built With

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds
